* What is this
This is a fast out of process logger that uses a shared ring buffer. The idea is
to just push values to another process that then formats and writes to a log.
This keeps the main process/thread from wasting time formatting data or writing
to a file.

* The ring buffer
The main communicaion channel is a single producer single consumer circular
buffer that maps its data ring twice in adjacent pages (so the buffer must be a
multiple of page size) and each side of the channel always sees the other party
ahead of it so it knows how far it can write. When it goes past the actual
capacity it resets its pointer and the local copy of the other side so it always
looks like it is behind the other.

* TODO

- [ ] clear up api to be more pure and put loggigng wrapper around it
- [ ] add 2MB huge page support
- [ ] add tests
